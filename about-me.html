            <p>I am Hardik Gupta</p>
            <p>I’m a data enthusiast driven by curiosity, precision, and a passion for problem-solving. I thrive on uncovering hidden patterns, 
               optimizing strategies, and transforming raw data into meaningful insights that fuel innovation and efficiency. 
               For me, data analytics is the perfect blend of logical structure and real-world impact—allowing me to make 
               data-driven decisions that shape businesses and drive progress. </p>
            <p class="quote uppercase center"><span class="colorful-letter">Everything</span> tells a story</p>
            <p>I firmly believe that growth happens when we push ourselves beyond our comfort zones. 
               I am continuously expanding my expertise in Python, SQL, machine learning, and business intelligence tools to 
                stay ahead in this ever-evolving field. From predictive modeling and automation to visualization and 
                storytelling, I enjoy bridging the gap between data and decision-making. 
                My goal is not just to analyze numbers but to bring clarity, drive strategy, and inspire action.</p>

            <p>It all began with a simple realization: I was spending way too much time manually updating spreadsheets 
                and double-checking numbers. One day, after what felt like the millionth copy-paste, 
                I thought </p>
            <p class="italic">- There has to be a smarter way to do this.</p>
            <p>Turns out, there was—data analytics. What started as an attempt to 
                make my life easier quickly turned into an obsession with uncovering patterns, automating tedious tasks, 
                and making data work for me instead of the other way around. realized data wasn’t just numbers on 
                a screen—it was a puzzle waiting to be solved, a story waiting to be told. Now, 
                I spend my time turning messy data into meaningful strategies, constantly learning
