            <h3 class="main-title">About my Technical Skill</h3>
            <p>As a data-driven professional, I continuously refine my technical expertise to drive insights and efficiency.
                My journey began with SQL, where I mastered querying and data manipulation using Snowflake, MySQL, Teradata, 
                and BigQuery. This foundation led me to Python, where I explored data analysis, automation, and AI-driven solutions,
                including Natural Language Processing (NLP) and predictive modeling. </p>
            <p>To enhance data visualization, 
                I became proficient in Tableau and Power BI, transforming complex datasets into actionable insights. 
                I also leveraged IBM Cognos (TM1), SAP, and Excel (VBA, Solver, Monte Carlo Simulations) for financial 
                modeling and strategic decision-making. Additionally, I integrated Alteryx and Power Automate to streamline 
                workflows and improve operational efficiency.</p>
            <p>With experience in Agile and Scrum methodologies, 
                I seamlessly collaborate with teams, ensuring smooth execution of data-driven initiatives. 
                My goal is to continuously evolve, blending analytics, automation, and business intelligence 
                to create impactful solutions.</p>
